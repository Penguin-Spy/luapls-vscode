# luapls-vscode
A VS Code extension that adds [luapls](https://github.com/raiguard/luapls/) as a language server for Lua.  
Like luapls, this extension is under development and not ready for use.

# Installing
Download the extension from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Penguin-Spy/luapls-vscode/releases/latest), then install the .vsix file in VS Code (click the 3 dots in the title of the Extensions menu).  
luapls is not bundled currently, so you will need to [build it yourself](https://github.com/raiguard/luapls/#build) and then provide the path to the executable in VS Code's settings.  
Note that luapls cannot handle Windows-formatted file URIs currently (so it likely won't even launch).
