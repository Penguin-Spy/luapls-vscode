# luapls-vscode
A VS Code extension that adds [luapls](https://github.com/raiguard/luapls/) as a language server for Lua.  
Like luapls, this extension is under development and not ready for use.

# Installing
[Build luapls](https://github.com/raiguard/luapls/#build), then copy the executable to this folder.  
Note that luapls cannot handle Windows-formatted file URIs currently (so it won't even launch).  
Start the extension from VS Code using Run and Debug.
